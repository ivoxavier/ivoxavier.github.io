<p>I've been using Ubuntu Touch since 2014, even before it was publicly available. Back then, I was running it on a Google Nexus 4 alongside Android.</p>
<p>It hit the market with the BQ e4.5 and Meizu MX4 in early 2015. Reviews were generally positive, highlighting its graphics (Unity) and intuitive gestures. However, the app store was quite limited at the time, hindering adoption from Android and iOS users. The novelty of the system kept us hopeful, but those hopes faded in April 2017 when Canonical discontinued the project.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the UBports community picked up the torch, and as of writing, Ubuntu Touch is more robust than ever, boasting a new app store, Android app compatibility, and a wider range of supported devices.</p>
<p>So, is Ubuntu Touch geared towards developers or consumers?</p>
<p>I recently had a conversation with a friend who used the system and found it "unfriendly." He cited a lack of essential apps (banking, messaging), missing features common in other systems, issues with notched displays, and the need to use the terminal for troubleshooting.</p>
<p>While some of these limitations, like the smaller app ecosystem and challenges with notched screens, are valid, others depend on individual needs. The idea of using the command line to fix problems might seem daunting to some.</p>
<p>However, he also praised its gesture-based navigation, minimalist design, convergence capabilities, and Waydroid (for running desktop apps).</p>
<p>These sentiments are common among Ubuntu Touch users. Many believe it's primarily a developer-oriented system rather than a consumer-ready one.</p>
<p>As a user, contributor, and developer myself, I have a vested interest in the platform. Over the past decade, my perspective has evolved, and I now have a more balanced view.</p>
<p>Every user has unique requirements, and no platform is perfect. Ubuntu Touch, in my opinion, isn't a "consumer OS" because it has a small, mostly unpaid developer community. Development is driven by individual passion, leading to features and fixes that align with their specific interests. While it's unfair to demand free work, it's also important to acknowledge that contributions may fluctuate as developers move on to other projects.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I wouldn't classify it as strictly a developer platform. While the user base leans towards tech-savvy individuals, Ubuntu Touch offers compelling features for a wider audience. It has its strengths and weaknesses, and its suitability depends on individual needs.</p>
<p>The UBports Foundation and its community have achieved remarkable feats given the project's scale. With time, I believe we'll see exciting advancements, but we must accept that development will be slower compared to giants like Apple and Google.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Ubuntu Touch is a viable option that shouldn't be overlooked. However, for the majority of users, it's not yet a mainstream choice.</p>
