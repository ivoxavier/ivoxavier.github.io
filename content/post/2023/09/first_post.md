### Welcome to my first blog!

First and foremost: Let me make it clear that I've **NEVER** considered myself a blogger!

While the primary focus of this space is technology-related content, you'll certainly come across a diverse range of topics here. The goal is to share my thoughts through 'blogs' whenever inspiration strikes.

For this blog project, I rely on the powerful combination of Hugo and GitHub Pages. Hugo's remarkable flexibility and the robust support of its community make it my absolute go-to choice. This choice also affords me the opportunity to customize the theme or seamlessly incorporate additional add-ons in the future. As for hosting the blog, it's as simple as can be: I leverage GitHub's user-friendly platform, made even more convenient with the GitHub Desktop app.
